          **Meet Chandu Chaman, the ultimate MILF Hunter!** A man so **done with
          life and studies** that he wishes for an alternate universe where no
          books exist and MILFs roam freely.
          <br /><br />
          **His goal?** To completely destroy this world and live peacefully,
          alone, with MILFs.
          <br /><br />
          **His biggest struggle?** The world keeps resisting his plans for
          destruction, and feminists exist (which he hates).
          <br /><br />
          Despite all odds, Chandu Chaman remains dedicated to his **quest for
          MILFs and world domination.** Aunties are still battling to be his
          queen, and episodes will continue **as long as MILFs demand them!**
