          Meet <strong>Nikuu Lal</strong>, the undefeated king of excuses! With
          a **PhD in Avoiding Responsibilities**, he somehow collects **degrees
          like Infinity Stones but still remains jobless.** <br /><br />
          His **life goal?** To debate over pointless things and badmouth his
          friends while secretly missing them.
          <br /><br />
          **Episodes?** Never-ending, as long as someone is there to give him
          attention. **Release Date?** Ongoing, but we’re all wondering when
          this tragic story will end.
          <br /><br />
          Whether it’s his love for **pink, his weird taste in “content” online,
          or his habit of simping for girls**, Nikuu Lal is the legend we didn’t
          ask for—but somehow, we got.

        🔥69 Lover, Nikuu Lal has already mastered the ancient art of
        simping—rumor has it,<br />
        he once sent “Good morning, jaan ❤️” to 69 girls before even brushing
        his teeth. 😭😂🔥
