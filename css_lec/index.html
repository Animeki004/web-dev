      Iron Man is a fictional superhero created by Marvel Comics, first
      appearing in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963. The character is the alter ego
      of Tony Stark, a billionaire genius, inventor, and industrialist who
      builds a high-tech armored suit to save his life and later uses it to
      protect the world. Stark's transformation from a self-centered weapons
      manufacturer to a heroic figure marks one of the most iconic journeys in
      comic book history. Played by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic
      Universe, Iron Man became a fan-favorite and a central figure in the
      Avengers, known for his intelligence, wit, and sacrifice.
